This is a basic weather app, which I built to try and understand both TypeScript (this was my first attemot; I think it went well), as well as learning to set up Redux with redux-toolkit (I am well aware that redux is complete overkill for a weather app). All code and styling by me. Weather data pulled from Open Weather API.
